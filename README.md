# Object Oriended Programming in C#
- Object-Oriented programming is a way of developing software applications using real-world terminologies to create entities that interact with one another using objects.

## Most Programming languages provide the following basic building blocks to build object-oriented applications:
- Classes: A Class define the structure using methods and properties/fields that resemble real-world entity.
- Methods: A method represents a particular behavior. It performs some action and might return information about an object, or update an object's data.
- Properties: Properties hold the data temporarily during execution of an application.
- Objects: Objects are instances of the class that holds different data in properties/fields and can interact with other objects.
- Interfaces: An interface is a contract that defines the set of rules for a particular functionality. They are used effectively with classes using OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism to make appplications more flexible.

## The followings are four main principles of object-oriented programming:
- a: Abstraction
- b: Encapsulation
- c: Inheritance
- d: Polymorphism
